## Coviscible 

Coviscible is a wearable to make health more accessible in a post Covid World. 

### Problem

In India during the pandemic people suffered from the acute shortage of medicines, vaccines, and other health related services. If there would have been a way to **track the availability of resources** and notify people in need , it would have saved thousands of lives. Moreover, inaccessibility of **information regarding lock downs** also lead to a lot of mishaps. Keeping track of all **precautions and preventive measures** is yet another issue.  Making all this information accessible to people anywhere anytime and keeping them reminded of the essential precautions is our goal. 

### Solution 

We made smart wearable connected to an Android app, that can help us set reminders of our medicines, vaccines, essential precautions and at the same time keep us updated about the local situation of the pandemic such as availability of medicines and lock downs. 

### Features 

1. Set Medicine and Vaccine Reminders for your whole Family
2. Never forget to take precautions and preventive measure ever again. 
3. Get to know about your local lock down updates 
4. Stay updated about the availability of the medicines and other health services at your local dispensary
