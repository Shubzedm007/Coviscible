## Coviscible 

Coviscible is a wearable to make health more accessible in a post-Covid World. 

### Problem

In India during the pandemic people suffered from an acute shortage of medicines, vaccines, and other health-related services. If there would have been a way to **track the availability of resources** and notify people in need, it would have saved thousands of lives. Moreover, the inaccessibility of **information regarding lockdowns** also leads to a lot of mishaps. Keeping track of all **precautions and preventive measures** is yet another issue.  Making all this information accessible to people anywhere anytime and keeping them reminded of the essential precautions is our goal. 
 
### Solution 

We made smart wearable connected to an Android app, that can help us set reminders of our medicines, vaccines, essential precautions and at the same time keep us updated about the local situation of the pandemic such as availability of medicines and lockdowns. 

### :star: Features 

1. Set Medicine and Vaccine Reminders for your whole Family
2. Never forget to take precautions and preventive measures ever again. 
3. Get to know about your local lockdown updates

### :page_with_curl: App Documentation
Coviscible mobile app is an android app developed over java that uses firebase as a database to fetch and upload details. Here the app provides some features - 


* **Add Precautions and Preventions for Relatives** - During this pandemic we all were at home and taking care of one other is everyone's duty in the family. This app will help to track all the safety precautions a family member needs to take and it will notify the parent of the family about the records of the other members.

* **Add Exercises** - As we all know the fitness is very important in this pandemic, and we all are at our home so maintaining fitness is a real challenge. So this app will provide you to add exercise which you want to do, and it will also give you suggestions based on other users. It will also notify the user based on the timing he selected for the exercise by reminding him.


* **Add Medicine** - As we saw most people forget to take their medicines. So to make them remember every time this app will provide a feature to add medicines a user needs to take. Users can also enable sanitizers and handwashing notifications which will notify the user on a particular interval of time.

The smartwatch will be well synced with the app so that each of the family members will be well connected and can easily track each other's health conditions.

It will also notify the public records of local Desipensary and other updates regarding the lockdown in their area with the help of data managed by the society members.

### :satellite: Future Work

1. Gathering more reliable public records of medicine stores. We have developed one other app which helps the hospital faculty to register patients and the resources they have. So with the help of that database, we can fetch the information regarding authentic resources.  
2. Link the watch with centrally verified resources regarding lockdown updates. 
3. Add support for covid APIs which will fetch the result based on location (where the user is currently staying) and update the user with the current statistics of the pandemic in their area.
4. Add support so that other users can also raise a request for resources as well as provide the resources to the person in need.
